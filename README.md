Flowise AI Agent - Assistant DataAnalyzer

Overview

This Flowise AI Agent is designed to analyze and extract structured data from datasets, images, and documents. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o model, LangChain-based prompt templates, and structured output parsing to ensure accurate and consistent results. Additionally, it includes self-improvement mechanisms and verification steps to enhance the quality of generated content.
